\subsection{Motivation}
%===========================================
Nowadays, a world without Internet is unimaginable for most people in developed countries.
As an example, 83\% of Germany's population has Internet access~\cite{globalfinance2012internetusage}. 
The benefits of the Internet are well-known and undeniable.
However, the Internet also leads to new kinds of threats.
One major issue of today's digitalized world is phishing. 
Even though many definitions exist depending on the given scenario or technique (cf.~\autoref{s:phishing_general}), phishing can be described as a form of fraud which lures users into disclosing confidential information, usually over fake websites.

According to the website Dr. Dobb's, for example, every day 500 million phishing e-mails are delivered to user inboxes~\cite{drdobb2012email}.
Commonly, these e-mails are addressed randomly and contain links to those malicious websites.
The Anti-Phishing Working Group~(APWG) reports that approximately 40,000 unique phishing websites are detected each month~\cite{antiphishingtrendreport2013}. Statistics published by Kaspersky Lab, a well-respected provider for IT security solutions, state that from year 2011-2012 to 2012-2013 the number of attacked users increased by about 87\%. 
While in 2011-2012, 19.9 million users were subject to phishing attempts, in 2012-2013 the numbers climbed up to 37.3 million. 
 Every day about 100,000 Internet users fall victims to phishing attacks, which is twice as much compared to the previous period. An immense increase can also be observed in the number of unique attack sources (i.e. IP addresses), which has tripled from 2012 to 2013~\cite{kasperskyreport2013}. 
Finally, RSA and ECM estimate worldwide costs caused by phishing at about \$1.5 billion for the year of 2012~\cite{rsa2013}. Note that according to Moore et al.~\cite{moore2010hard} phishing statistics might be inherently biased. 
The problem is, there are several ways to interpret collected data. 
Hence, every party might assess their data with respect to their interests resulting in diverse statistics. 
Diversity can also result from setting different foci.
Therefore, the reliability of such statistics, including the ones mentioned above, is questionable. 
%We cannot know whether the disparity between several statistics is the result of different foci or of personal interest. 
Regardless of the reliability and accuracy of the above mentioned statistics it is undeniable that the problem of phishing is prevalent.
% and needs to be additionally addressed with other approaches than technical solutions since they do not 
% seem to suffice.

Several technical solutions to counter phishing have already been proposed in literature.
These include, but are not limited to, e-mail spam filters, URL blacklists, or website takedowns.
These systems intend to protect the user from the enormous amount of phishing attempts. 
Spam filters, for example, sort out phishing e-mails before they even reach the receiver~\cite{bergholz2010new,chandrasekaran2006phishing,fette2007learning}.
The major drawbacks of spam filters are that phishers are constantly improving their techniques to circumvent these. Additionally, it is difficult to determine a good threshold for the aggressiveness of the filters to balance false positives and negatives. 
Thus, it is possible that phishing e-mails make it through these filters and might harm the user.
An alternative approach is the usage of browsers restricting access to or displaying warnings before accessing phishing websites with the aid of so called URL blacklists~\cite{ma2009beyond, zhang2008highly}.
The major downside of blacklists is that most of them work reactively.
Thus, there is a certain time frame where phishing websites are active without being blacklisted.
In this time frame users can access fraudulent websites without being warned or restricted and thus are susceptible to an attack.
Even though some dynamic and predictive approaches have been proposed~\cite{prakash2010phishnet, obied2009fraudulent, balzarotti2012proactive}, similar to spam filters, there will always be malicious websites which can bypass protective systems (false negatives).
 Furthermore, the weakest link in the security chain is the user: there exist users who ignore security warnings and thus remain susceptible to phishing and other threats.
A field study conducted by Akhawe et al.~\cite{akhawe2013alice} revealed that 10\% of Mozilla Firefox's and 25\% of Google Chrome's malware and phishing warnings are clicked through, i.e. ignored.
 As a matter of fact, such systems are rendered superfluous for users who disregard the warnings.
Website takedowns depict another approach to counter phishing. Here, certain parties commonly urge hosting providers to take down revealed malicious websites.
Such parties include, for instance, banks, other organizations or specialized takedown companies~\cite{moore2007examining}.
 The removal of phishing websites is an effective solution, since it implicitly solves the aforementioned problem, where users ignore security warnings: a removed website cannot trick a user into entering sensitive data.
Yet, the average life time of a phishing website is 61.69 hours~\cite{moore2007examining}, i.e. the site is online and available for 2.5 days during which falling for it remains a threat.
Thus, this approach cannot entirely defeat phishing. 
Obviously, the technical solutions provide protection to a certain degree but cannot assure an overall protection from phishing for two reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textit{Accuracy of Technical Solutions:} 
First, there will always be false negatives, especially when attackers invent new, more sophisticated deceptions that bypass current prevention systems.
Therefore, users should not rely on technical solutions only. 
Otherwise there is still the chance that users will fall into the attackers' traps whenever the technical assistance fails.
	\item\textit{User Behavior and Knowledge:} Another major issue with technical approaches to counter phishing is user behavior.
 As indicated above users tend to overlook or deliberately ignore security warnings.
 If the user behavior does not change such approaches will remain unhelpful for those who do not take them seriously.
 The problem is that users primarily make use of the Internet for purposes like online shopping, online banking, communicating with relatives and friends etc.
 Aspects related to security are not of their primary interest.
%or they just implicitly assume the system to be secure.
 Another factor for overlooking and ignoring these warnings might be the lack of security awareness.
 Some users might just not be aware of how easy it is for even inexperienced attackers to duplicate a website or send out fake e-mails on behalf of trusted companies or persons.
 Even if users are aware that there is a certain degree of threat in the Internet, people tend to believe the probability of facing such an attack is very low and that it will not happen to them, until it actually happens to them or to relatives/friends.
\end{enumerate}

The statistics of phishing further support that technical solutions do not seem to suffice.
Therefore, we believe that a complementary approach is required to compensate the weaknesses of technical solutions and minimize the threat phishing poses.
We regard the raise of user security awareness and the offer of a service for education as a further key step against phishing.
Increased security awareness may change user behavior and attitude towards taking the warnings of protective tools more seriously.
The user education can help users defend themselves in cases such technical tools fail or also in cases where no tools are available.
The opinions on whether user education and increased security awareness will help combat phishing are divided among researchers.
There exist security researchers and experts who argue that user education is pointless~\cite{useredupointless, bruceschneieronsecuritytraining}.
Other sources emphasize the need for increased security awareness and education of the users~\cite{usereducebit, usereduscmagazine}.
It also seems that there already exist promising and effective anti-phishing education approaches~\cite{kumaraguru2007protecting, sheng2007antiphishingphil}, yet with the need for further improvements which we discuss in \autoref{s:related_work}.
Ultimately, we believe that technical solutions will never suffice to protect the end user entirely.
Therefore, there is the need for complementary approaches.
The users need to learn that they have to protect themselves and how they can achieve this protection.

\subsection{Goals}
%===========================================
\label{s:goals}
The major goal of this work is to offer users a service which educates them about phishing so that they are less likely to fall for fraudulent webpages in the future.
In detail, the goals we aspire to achieve can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Increasing the users' security awareness to complement pure technical solutions for countering phishing attempts.
	\item Elaborate on both an appealing as well as valuable educational approach which helps the user achieve the capabilities required to identify phishing websites.
	\item Evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in a final user study.
\end{enumerate}
The lack of the users' security awareness seems to be a major issue concerning their security related behavior.
 For this reason we want to raise the users' security awareness hoping that this will increase their attention while it will decrease their vulnerability.
 Moreover, besides technical solutions and increasing their security awareness, it is important to provide the users with information so that they can learn to protect themselves against phishing attacks in the future.
Finally, we want to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in a user study with respect to whether it actually can help the users protect themselves and how well it is received by them.

\subsection{Outline}
%===========================================


This thesis consists of eleven main chapters: Introduction, Background, Related Work, Preliminary Considerations Regarding an Anti-Phishing Education App, Target Group, Initial User Survey, App Teaching Content, App Structure and Design, App Development Process, App Evaluation and Conclusion. Their purpose is as follows:
\newline
\newline
Chapter 1 motivates this work. It describes why phishing is important to address and why technical solutions do not suffice and need to be complemented with user education. Moreover, it states the goals of our work.
\newline
\newline
Chapter 2 explains background knowledge which is beneficial for the comprehension of our work. 
It shows that many definitions exist depending on the given scenario or technique and presents our definition of the term ``phishing''. Furthermore, it points out the consequences of falling for a phishing attack and motivates that our educational service should be implemented as a smartphone app.
Finally, it provides an overview of anti-phishing education approaches of previous work.
\newline
\newline
Chapter 3 gives specific examples of related work. These examples are categorized according to the introduced classes of the previous chapter. Moreover, it states in which way our work is to be distinguished from previous work. 
\newline
\newline
Chapter 4 elaborates on the determination of our scope to educate users about phishing. 
There, all of our choices are gathered and system requirements are summarized.
Furthermore, it explains what assumptions we had to make and states the limitations of our work.
\newline
\newline
Chapter 5 deals with the target group we want to address with our app.
After defining our target audience it explains how the target group can be projected to the German population.
\newline
\newline
Chapter 6 deals with our initial user survey we had conducted in order to gain some input before elaborating on the app design. After illustrating the main objectives of this survey the chapter presents the results and discusses how the answers influenced our further app elaborations.
\newline
\newline
Chapter 7 describes and elaborates on different teaching contents which can potentially be communicated to the user. At the same time it reasons our decision whether to communicate the specific content or not.
\newline
\newline
Chapter 8 presents our final approach for the app design and structure.
\newline
\newline
Chapter 9 summarizes important steps concerning the development process of our app.
